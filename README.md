# respiratory-clustering

Respiration is an incredibly dynamic, persistent physiological signal. Breathing is influenced by changing metabolic needs, nuanced orofacial movements, and autonomic tone associated with emotional states. First, this project compiles detailed respiratory parameters, extracted via BreathMetrics, across well-defined rodent behaviors. Then the application of unbiased clustering determines underlying trends in respiration acorss behaviors. Finally, the use of supervised machine learning through a k-nearest neighbor classifier, demonstrates the predictive value of behavior through tracking respiration.
